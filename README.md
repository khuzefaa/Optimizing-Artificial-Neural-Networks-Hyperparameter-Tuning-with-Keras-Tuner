# Optimizing-Artificial-Neural-Networks-Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Keras-Tuner
Implemented a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and applied hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner to optimize model performance. Explored key parameters like the number of layers, units, and learning rate to achieve improved accuracy on classification tasks.
